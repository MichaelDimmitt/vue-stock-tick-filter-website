## Stock Ticker Website to teach vue to others.

This project is a skeleton project leveraging Vue, Bulma, and Webpack (NPM for dependencies).

This project is built in ES6 syntax ([example IDE configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35425915/how-do-i-enable-es6-syntax-in-webstorm))

This project was a development assignment that turned into a good vue project for teaching others.

Content added to the project:
1) Testing, https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/vue-stock-tick-filter-website/pull/5 <br/>
The test plugin may be added by Vue CLI after the initial project creation using: `vue add @vue/unit-jest`
2) All of the lifecycle methods are demonstrated in the project.
3) Vue.register(component) registration.
4) Dynamic component routing in vue.
5) Vue Instance Variables.
6) Vue Local Storage State. - note localStorage saves your content as a string.
7) Computed Properties vs Watchers
8) Filter Search and Sort can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/vue-stock-tick-filter-website/blob/master/src/lib/apiFilter.js)
9) localStorage and computed properties example can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/vue-stock-tick-filter-website/blob/master/src/views/Symbols.vue)

To Be Done
2) Vuex.
4) ** Let me know if you think of more things [to do in Issues](https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/vue-stock-tick-filter-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) **
